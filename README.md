movieLister
===========

OBS! This code uses mymovieapi.org / imbdpapi.com(http://imdbapi.com/) that is no longer up and running. This code therefore no longer works. See http://imdbapi.com/(http://imdbapi.com/) for more info

A Perl based web system that lists information, gets trailers and covers about movies stored on a hard drive.

For more documentation, how to on installation, information about the system and screenshots:
  Go to www.team-holm.net, click the code tab, from the rolldown menu choose movieLister. 
  
  
There is a long list of added functionality to come to this system. It will be listed here on a later occation.

One of the first objectives with further development of this code is to make it more reusable. 
To do this, I plan to implement more object orientation in the code to create more encapsulation, 
ease of re-use and possible later polymorphism. In generel re-organize the code from something of a spaghetti 
to something that is more readable and comprehendable.
